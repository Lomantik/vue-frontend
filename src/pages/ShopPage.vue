        The difference between style and fashion is quality. Age is something only in your head or a
        stereotype. Age means nothing when you are passionate about something. I can't get sucked
        into that celebrity thing, because I think it's just crass. I've always tried to push myself
        technically and to push myself visually. That's been part of the journey. I would like to be
        a one-man multinational fashion phenomenon. My aim is to make the poor look rich and the
        rich look poor. If you wear clothes that don't suit you, you're a fashion victim. You have
        to wear clothes that make you look better. I am not interested in shock tactics. I just want
        to make beautiful clothes. Money is the most corrosive aspect of life today because it means
        that all attention to detail is forgotten. I always loved aesthetics. Not particularly
        fashion, but an idea of beauty. It is not easy to dress well. Over the years I have learned
        that what is important in a dress is the woman who is wearing it. It is not easy to dress
        well. For me, art is about learning and about living with people. It's alive. A lot of
        self-importance goes on in the fashion industry. I'm not like that.
